            <p>Hello! I am Dexter Parker, a recent film and television graduate with a passion for screenwriting and film. I have worked on various projects during my studies and am eager to share my portfolio with you. Please take a look at some of my work below.</p>

                <h3>Off The Scent</h3>
                <p>This was an enjoyable experience. Writing the script was great, although challenging, as every crew member had their own suggestions. I had to find a way to balance everyone's ideas, which resulted in a story that was at times hard to follow. Nevertheless, it was a great experience, and I had fun as I enjoy the slasher genre and horror. I believe I managed to build suspense initially, but I feel the ending could have been more sufficient and deserving.</p>

                <h3>Fa√ßade Of Deceit</h3>
                <p>I enjoyed writing this script. There are a few segments that could have been tightened. I am not too happy with the ending, as I now wish I had left it open-ended without writing the mother's death. Instead, I should have left it so that the criminal died at the hands of the mother and son, highlighting the lengths a mother will go to for her son. Alternatively, I could have ended on a cliffhanger before the loan shark makes an attempt to get our protagonist.</p>
